# Baltic Grocery Retail Market Analysis

This project is based on a real-world internship assignment in which I analyzed the grocery retail market across the Baltic States â€” Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia. The focus was to understand the structure, current trends, and to identify investable opportunities using strategic, financial, and market data.

## Overview

The Baltic grocery market shows both consolidation and fragmentation: while Lithuania is dominated by a few large players, Latvia and Estonia have more regional diversity. Urbanization, inflation, and post-COVID behavior have driven a shift toward value-focused formats, e-commerce, and private label products.

## Key Insights

- **Market Concentration**: Top 3 players hold 60â€“75% of share, with variation across countries.
- **Trends**: Rising demand for value, digital loyalty programs, and smaller-format urban stores.
- **Challenges**: Inflation, supply shocks, and consumer fatigue with traditional formats.

## Strategic Opportunities

1. **Costco-Style Retailer**  
   Adapting the U.S. membership warehouse model (e.g., using Promo Cash & Carry) to introduce low-margin, high-volume retail backed by subscription revenue.

2. **Rural Roll-Up Strategy**  
   Acquiring and modernizing regional chains like Å ilas, AibÄ—, Coop, etc., to improve logistics and purchasing power.

3. **Digital Infrastructure Development**  
   Building an AI-powered, omnichannel retail platform that enhances customer loyalty and operational efficiency.

## Risks Considered

- Macroeconomic pressures (e.g., inflation, wage stagnation)
- Competitive response from Maxima, Rimi, and Lidl
- Technical and operational complexity of membership or digital formats
- Consumer resistance to unfamiliar models

## Tools Used

- **PowerPoint** for presentation design
- **Excel** for calculations and forecasts
- **Canva** for visuals
- **Internship research and external sources** (World Bank, Eurostat, Euromonitor)
