# Project 3 Title

In this folder, include all the files you used to create your visualization (.ipynb, .csv, whatever) as well as a hi-res or pdf version of your final visualizations. 

In this document:
 - Include a large image of your visualization ```![image alt text](image_file.png)```
 - Cite any data sources
 - List the tools used
 - Again, you're going to describe this project. You are answering What? Why? and How? You can re-use the blurb on the welcome page, but expand a little.
